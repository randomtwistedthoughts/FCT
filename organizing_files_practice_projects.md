# Reading and Writing Files — Practice Projects

## **1. Selective Copy**
Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for files with a certain file extension (such as `.pdf` or `.jpg`). Copy these files into a new folder.

## **2. Deleting Unneeded Files**
Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for files or folders over 100 MB. Print their absolute paths so they can be removed.

## **3. Filling in the Gaps**
Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix (such as `spam001.txt`, `spam002.txt`, etc.) and fixes any numbering gaps. Then create another program that inserts gaps intentionally.
